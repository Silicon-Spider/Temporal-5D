# Changelog

Every change to this repository is recorded here, in the same edit that makes it,
and the spec is brought in line with it - upstream: the spec and the register are
not edited here, and the edits they need are proposed in `docs/BUILD_LOG.md` (the
rule is in `AGENTS.md`). Newest first. Each entry says what changed and why, and
ends with a `Spec:` line: which sections of the design spec and the decision
register the change bears on and what was proposed for them, or that no part of
the spec describes the change.

## Unreleased

### 2026-10-02 - The engine's first gate runs triaged; the first known divergences

- `oracles/known-divergences.toml`: 56 entries from the triage of the engine's
  first gate runs (engine configured locally only): 37 for ftxi's and ftxi:naive's
  check verdicts that ruling R1 rules wrong; Chess in 5D's two false checkmates
  (2) and ftxi's missing Black two-timeline double step (4) - the two oracle
  defects, recorded as telltales as ruling R7 asks; 7 for record text the notation
  specification rules out (jumps without a source square, a parenthesised
  variation, 5DFEN boards under a named Board), which the engine refuses and an
  oracle played; 6 for oracles' own notation errors (ftxi's missing unmoved markers
  on Very Small - Open, ftxi's refusal of `+1` timeline labels, the notation
  parser's refusal of `(0T1)a2a3`). Each cites the rulebook or the notation
  specification. `verify` passes; with the engine configured the nightly gate
  matches every reachable entry, none stale, no telltale.
- No engine defect was found. Standard - Half Reflected is the first gated ruleset.
  115 findings that rules Q4 explains remain, so the engine stays unconfigured in
  the committed `gate.toml` until the project owner rules on Q4.
- `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`: the triage (step 2), the plan, register rows H23, H34.
- Spec: §11.0 "Running the gate" (H23, H31, H34, H36, H38; R1, R4, R7); no spec
  text changes.

### 2026-10-02 - Engine: a turn number that does not count the turns is a warning

- `engine/`: by default (`PgnOptions::turn_number_mismatch_is_error`, false) a turn
  number that does not count the turns is kept in `PgnRecord::warnings` (and
  `PgnReplay::warnings()`, printed by `t5d-gate`) and reading goes on; a turn
  really missing still shows, since the next action's moves are checked like any
  other. notation/aivsai (turn 25 written twice) now replays all 54 actions. The
  same policy as the annotations below: the gate compares more, never less.
- Spec: §11.0 "Running the gate" (H28: what the engine reads); the notation's
  "Turns"; no spec text changes.

### 2026-10-02 - Engine: a disagreeing annotation is a warning, not a refusal

- `engine/`: a `~`, `(>Lx)` or `(~Tx)` that disagrees with the state no longer
  makes the move unreadable by default (`PgnOptions::annotation_mismatch_is_error`,
  false): the move is played and the disagreement kept in `PgnReplay::warnings()`,
  which `t5d-gate` prints on stderr; `--strict-annotations` restores the refusal.
  The notation specification calls these tokens "purely for better human
  comprehension" that "should match" the state; a wrong one is the writer's slip,
  and refusing hid the rest of three corpus records from the gate: cwmtt/silly now
  replays all 38 actions (CHECKPOINT 1's CHK-A1 representative, position 28, is
  not check under R1 - 37 legal actions, as ftxi and cwmtt count) and
  chessin5d-illegal-move-example all 66 (position 66: in check, 25 legal actions,
  not the checkmate Chess in 5D's mate search reported); cwmtt/wide now stops at
  rules Q4 instead. Tests: the strict reading kept for the annotation tests, a new
  test of the default.
- Spec: §11.0 "Running the gate" (H28, H30: what the engine reads); rules T15, Q26;
  no spec text changes.

### 2026-10-02 - Phase 1 measurements: movegen throughput (M9) and the corpus |E| curve (M7)

- `docs/MEASUREMENTS.md`: M9 measured on a quiet machine with `t5d-bench`.
  Pseudo-legal expansion (moves, move graph, W/E scope, typed relations) runs at
  44,047/s at 240 boards and 24,951/s at 600 on one thread - 2.2x and 2.5x M9's
  targets, outside the ±10% STOP band; the frozen-history term is 0.48 ns per board
  (2% of an expansion at 600 boards); matched flatness of the spec's expansion is
  +7% median, inconclusive by rounds. With the legal-moves filter the expansion
  takes milliseconds to minutes: a fail to fix before search. M7: the corpus curve
  recorded (upper bounds); no verdict - real games reach 240-399 boards in two
  games and run 16-24 active timelines.
- `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`: register rows M7, M9; the plan.
- Spec: §15.6 (M7, M9), §15.3 (movegen throughput); spec issues 20, 21, 26, 46.

### 2026-10-02 - The gate, step 2B: stable answers, integrity, telltales, parse mode, the rulebook pin

- `oracles/` (H32): every source is recorded twice (`golden --write --repeat 2`);
  a value that differs between recordings is unstable and compared by nothing, one
  a limit stopped is "unknown at budget X". Per-position costs go in
  `golden/<source>.cost.json`. A tier requires exactly the stable values whose
  recorded cost x `[stability] margin` fits its budget - and 100% of them: the
  coverage floors and the proof channel's 90% ratio are gone, replaced by a
  static non-vacuity check. A calibration probe reports how much slower a runner
  is than the recording machine. The golden files are re-recorded (schema 3).
- H33: `golden/MANIFEST` holds every recorded file's SHA-256, verified before any
  comparison; each gate run loads one verified snapshot (closing the window in
  which an engine could append a known divergence excusing itself); the harness's
  files are re-hashed after the engine runs and a change fails the run;
  `harness.py` imports its own modules from source only, so a planted bytecode or
  extension module is never loaded. `.github/CODEOWNERS` owns `/oracles/` and
  `/.github/`.
- H34: an engine answer that agrees with a known divergence's recorded oracle
  error, by the comparison's own rule, is a telltale: it fails the gate and is
  never reported stale.
- The engine's parse mode (`[engine] mode = "parse"`) compares states, replay
  length and acceptance, never check, counts or mate, and never enables the proof
  channel. In either mode an engine's `rejected`/`unreadable` - after positions,
  or refusing a set-up - is a soft legality divergence that only a notation
  citation can excuse, and the ruleset stays ungated.
- The CHECKPOINT 1 rulings: `in_check` means H36's check status; a source that
  names a search limit and still gives a verdict is malformed (H37); the rulebook
  is pinned in `gate.toml` (`harness.py rulebook`, `rulebook --pin`), and `verify`
  fails when it changes until it is re-pinned (H38).
- `legal_actions` is defined: an action is its set of moves, with its
  timeline-creating moves in the order they create timelines - two orders of two
  branching moves are two actions. ftxi and cwmtt list exactly that at every
  position both read; a protocol definition, not a rules ruling.
- `.github/workflows/oracle-commit.yml`, `oracle-nightly.yml`: the engine's gate
  adapter is built before the gate, and the build is checked to have changed
  nothing under `oracles/` (the harness-modified check only sees changes made
  while the gate runs).
- Reviewed adversarially (17 findings, all applied). 601 harness tests. The golden
  files were re-recorded on a quiet machine (the commit tier's calibration probe
  then ran at 1.00x the recording machine's time); no recorded answer changed.
- `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`: the forbidden ways of making the gate pass now
  name budgets, the margin, `proof_share`, cost files, `calibration.json`,
  `MANIFEST`, re-recording on a loaded machine and moving the rulebook pin
  unreviewed; `CLAUDE.md`: the two-recording command and `rulebook`.
- Spec: §11.0 "Running the gate" (H32, H33, H34, H36, H37, H38); proposed spec
  edits 24-26 in `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`.

### 2026-10-02 - Engine: the hypercuboid lets a castling precede moves that rewind the present

- `engine/src/hypercuboid.cpp`: the general realisation (alternative rulesets only)
  made the moves that create no timeline in ascending order between creations,
  assuming they commute. Under Q3 (activation by play), Q4's other reading and
  Q21's alternative (castling on mandatory boards only) they do not: a move on an
  inactive opponent timeline behind the present rewinds the present off the
  castling board, so the castling must come first. The hypercuboid then
  under-counted (238 of 254 actions in the reviewer's example; 165 of 400 positions
  of a random family), which the gate's cross-check would have reported as a
  detector disagreement; no wrong verdict was found. A castling is now exempt from
  the order. Found by a follow-up adversarial review that otherwise matched both
  detectors with an independent brute-force reference on 21,717 positions and
  73,013 mid-action states under 22 ruleset configurations, H37 holding under
  17,860 budgeted searches and at the memory ceiling.
- `engine/tests/test_detectors.cpp`: the reviewer's position as a regression test
  (it failed before the fix). `engine/README.md`: the realisation's description.
- Spec: §11.0 item 3 (H37); no spec text changes.

### 2026-10-02 - Engine stage E4: check, legality, legal actions, mate detection, the gate's full mode

- `engine/` (merged from its worktree branch): check status and submission
  legality exactly as rulebook R1 and H36 state them - one royal-capture scan with
  the move generator's semantics, held equal to it on random multiverses; the
  default check ruling of `GameState::submit` and of the replay (an action that
  leaves a royal capturable is `cannot_submit`; `CheckRuling::none()` keeps
  pseudo-legal play). `CastlingAttacks::AnyBoard` removed (H40).
- Legal actions: `count_legal_actions` counts the harness's actions (a move set,
  its timeline-creating moves in creation order); `count_legal_successors` counts
  distinct successor states; `list_legal_actions` lists them.
- Mate detection (C5, C8, C9, C13; H37): a naive depth-first detector and a
  hypercuboid detector designed in-house from spec §11.0 item 3 (design note in
  `engine/README.md`; no oracle source read), realising points by regime and
  eliminating whole boxes by an abstract check. Checkmate and stalemate only from
  an exhaustive search; any node, time or memory budget answers "unknown", tested
  for every node budget below the exhaustive need. Every search has a memory
  ceiling (unbudgeted naive diagnostics had reached 48 GB).
- `t5d-gate` full mode: in_check, legal_actions, terminal - unbudgeted, via a
  hypercuboid-then-naive portfolio on doubling budgets with a cross-check (a
  disagreement ends the run in `error`); diagnostics for hand investigation. The
  whole corpus runs in 8.3 s.
- `ExpandOptions::legal_moves` (off by default): the expansion's moves restricted to
  those that begin a legal action; too slow to turn on (spec issue 46).
- 355 tests, plus long cross-checks (`t5d-tests --long`) against a brute-force
  reference at turn starts and mid-action - 4,000 positions and 17,207 mid-action
  states, no disagreement. Reviewed adversarially three times: no soundness bug
  (an independent brute-force reference matched both detectors on about 6,660
  positions under 15 rulesets); the search-time defect, the count definition and
  the test gaps they found are fixed, and the fix round's reference caught and
  fixed a naive miscount.
- `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`: step 4, register rows H22, H36, H37, H40, spec issues 44-47,
  proposed spec edits 38-40. `docs/MEASUREMENTS.md`: the full-mode corpus timings
  and the legal-moves filter's cost.
- Spec: §11.0 items 1-5 (H22, H36, H37, H40), §15.6 (M9: the filter), spec issues
  28 and 44-47, proposed edits 38-40.

### 2026-10-02 - Network CI: the FP32-resolution FP8 test absorbs one rounding flip

- `python/tests/net/test_cache.py`: the test that the FP8 cache equals the FP8
  network's forward at FP32 resolution bounded the policy's largest logit gap at
  5e-4, tighter than one FP8 rounding flip, which a platform's FP32 summation order
  can tip: on Linux one flip moved a logit by 1.3e-3 and the network job failed
  (557 of 558 passed). The bound is now 5e-3; the trunk-RMS and value bounds,
  which separate a real fault from a flip by about 400x (mutant M14 gives trunk
  RMS 7.4e-3 against 1.2-1.8e-5), are unchanged.
- Spec: §15.2 row (e) - tolerance matched to the arithmetic, as its protocol says.

### 2026-10-02 - The network stack, stage N3: the block-causal scope and the cached path (random weights)

- `python/t5d/net/`: the block-causal scope (C17, C19) as `NetConfig.attn_scope`
  (`dense`, the default per C1; `block_causal`), through every attention path with
  rows built per block (`scope.py`); lineage on the input contract
  (`PositionState.parent` - the arrival side - `creation`, and `source`, a
  travel's departure board; validated, remapped, carried on `Batch`, recorded by
  the synthetic generator and the tree fixture). Committed-class points are
  parameters with placeholder defaults: `causal_past` (lineage | two_parent |
  creation), `frozen_features` (intrinsic | current), `supersession_scope` (C20's
  two readings), `frozen_kv_format` (match | fp8, applied by the forward itself).
  Under the scope the §6 structure opens live rows only.
- The cached path (C2 as built for §15.2 and §15.3, `cache.py`): per-board K/V
  content-addressed by (epoch, dependency digest) - §7.2's radix structure; every
  frozen board computed one at a time in its own frame, so evaluations are bitwise
  path-independent; supersession recomputed once under the state-defined mask
  (C20), never snapshotted (C21); the live pass per node; root refresh (C3) and
  the rung-1 node refresh (C3a, V = 50) forking epochs copy-on-write, history
  membership by intrinsic identity; storage in the network's own frozen-K/V format
  (G1). A search-tree fixture (`tree.py`), references with the two-level mask, the
  spec's cost model with counted FLOPs (`cost.py`), and a benchmark that measures
  its own machine's load and refuses a busy one (`cache_bench.py`).
- 111 tests for §15.2's network rows (a)-(e) over adversarial geometries; 558
  pass. Reviewed adversarially twice (equivalence and fidelity; cost method): 12
  findings, all addressed. 27 injected mutants, every behaviour-changing one
  caught.
- `docs/MEASUREMENTS.md`: the counted §15.3 figures at the spec's timeline counts
  and at the corpus's 24 (CPU wall times wait for a quiet machine).
  `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`: register rows C1-C4, C12, C15, C17, C19-C21, G1; spec
  issues 29-43; proposed spec edits 27-37.
- Spec: §2.3, §6, §7.1-§7.3, §7.6, §7.9, §8.5, §8.7, §10.2, §10.3, §11.3, §15.2,
  §15.3; A3, A4, B9-B12, C1-C3, C3a, C11, C15, C17, C19-C21, G1, H18. Spec issue 5
  is built as parameters (the choice is the user's); spec issues 29-43; proposed
  edits 27-37.

### 2026-10-02 - Engine CI: t5d-bench builds on Linux

- `engine/tools/t5d_bench.cpp`: the synthetic seeds are computed with
  `std::uint64_t` literals. With `ull` literals, g++ 13 and 14 on Linux - where
  `uint64_t` is `unsigned long`, not `unsigned long long` as on MinGW - warn under
  `-Wsign-conversion`, and the engine job failed on E3's commit.
- Spec: no part of the spec describes the build.

### 2026-10-02 - Engine stage E3: expansion, its C API, the Phase 1 measurement tools

- `engine/`: `expand()` (`t5d/expand.hpp`, `src/expand.cpp`, `t5d/records.h`)
  produces, for the player to move, the pseudo-legal moves (with capture, travel
  and branching flags), the move graph (B9), W(k) - each active timeline's band of
  k half-turns plus branch origins, reported apart - and E(k), the out-of-window
  travel destinations (§10.4.1), with source boards outside W counted apart;
  side-to-move typed relations behind flags (attack, defence, x-ray - B11,
  provisional; pin and check are E4's; travel-threat is undefined); board and
  square features in `python/t5d/net/state.py`'s layout, plus the lineage parent.
  No per-frozen-board work - per-board arrays are computed on first use - and no
  allocation in steady state. Moves are chosen in one place, ready for E4's legal
  actions.
- C API games: from a record, 5DFEN or a variant; replay, apply and submit under a
  per-game check ruling; expand into flat arrays.
- Tools: `t5d-measure` (per-position W/E at k = 0/4/8/16, and `--summary`, a curve
  de-duplicated by position and game) and `t5d-bench` (search-like streams,
  interleaved rounds, thread CPU time, thread scaling, raw / matched / no-move
  flatness series, reported as ranges and labels, never verdicts); a seeded
  generator of SYNTHETIC positions for throughput only.
- 40 new tests (299), including a ruleset-aware from-scratch reference; reviewed
  adversarially (19 findings, all dealt with: 18 fixed, one a question about the
  brief's STOP band); 20 injected mutants killed.
- `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`: step 5's state, preliminary figures (loaded machine - not
  measurements), the reading of the brief's ±10% STOP band, spec issues 17-28,
  proposed spec edits 19-23.
- Spec: §6 (B9, B11), §10.4.1-§10.4.3 (C5, C7 - measurement only; no window
  code), §11.1, §15.6 (M7, M9); spec issues 17-28 and proposed edits 19-23 in the
  build log.

### 2026-10-01 - Upstream drafts of the two oracle defects; network CI fix

- `docs/checkpoints/upstream/`: draft bug reports for the user to file (rulebook
  R7) - 5d-chess-js's exhaustive mate search passes a search-tree node where a board
  is expected, generates no moves and reports checkmate where a legal turn exists;
  ftxi's move generator never gives a Black pawn or brawn the two-timeline double
  step. Each has a hand-built minimal record verified on the pinned code, the root
  cause at the pinned commit, a fix checked in a scratch copy, and the rule from
  public sources; the README lists what to check before filing.
- `python/t5d/net/heads.py`: the value head's bin centres are computed from
  integers. `torch.linspace` put the middle centre at 2.2e-8 on Linux, not 0, and
  the first Linux run of the network job failed on it (446 of 447 passed); a draw
  must sit exactly on a centre.
- `.gitignore`: agent worktrees (`.claude/worktrees/`).
- `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`: the 18 Q1 positions confirmed unmoved under the count rule
  from the checkpoint's data; the drafts' state and two further ftxi leads.
- Spec: §11.0 "Triage by cluster" and H31 (the defects found by triage);
  §8.3 / D3 (the value head's 51 bins - no spec change); nothing else.

### 2026-10-01 - The network stack, stages N1 and N2 (random weights)

- `python/` (package `t5d`, PyTorch on CPU; `cd python; py -m pytest`), built to
  spec §2-§9 with random weights - no training run:
  - N1, dense v1: the token layout (66N + 16, board-major) and its input contract
    (`t5d/net/state.py`, the boundary the rules engine will fill); piece and
    per-board features with Δt-to-present; 4D RoPE with asymmetric pairs in FP32;
    2 per-board and 16 global registers; the trunk (d 256, L 16, 8 heads, FFN 8x)
    under BF16 autocast; the bilinear pointer policy over candidate moves, the
    51-bin value head and the auxiliary heads; 21,358,601 parameters (F1) and the
    L24-ff12 preset (F2); synthetic positions and a training smoke test of a few
    optimiser steps on synthetic data (allowed by the brief - no training run).
  - N2, the attention structure: the move-graph mask on 2 heads (B9); the routing
    table (B10), typed edge biases (B11) and board-pair smolgen (B12, full rank
    over relative board-pair cells) behind flags; B14's block-sparse attention in
    a CPU gather form, the default, with per-block recomputation under autograd,
    and chunked and dense paths as references.
  - 447 tests: masks against brute-force key sets, chunked and block-sparse equal
    dense (outputs and gradients), invariances (board order, translation, batch
    composition), precision bounds, parameter counts, no inert switch; 73
    injected mutants across the two stages, all killed. Each stage was reviewed
    adversarially and every finding (15 for N1, 12 for N2) fixed.
- `.github/workflows/network.yml`: lint and test on ubuntu-24.04 when `python/`
  changes, with PyTorch 2.13.0 (CPU), NumPy 2.5.2 and ruff 0.16.5.
- Spec: §2.1-§2.3, §3.1-§3.2, §4.1, §5, §6, §6.1, §8.1, §8.3, §9.2, §10.1, §10.2,
  §12.4, §13.1 item 6, §14.4; A1-A3, B1-B2, B4-B6, B8-B12, B14, D1, D3, D4, F1,
  F2, G1. Committed-class ambiguities are parameters with placeholder defaults
  (spec issues 9 and 16); proposed spec edits 5-9 (N1) and 12-18 (N2) in
  `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`.

### 2026-10-01 - The rulebook records the CHECKPOINT 1 rulings

- `docs/rules/README.md` is now the project's rulebook (H38): a preamble ranks the
  sources (in-game Guide > cited developer rulings > established references >
  forums), labels silent cases as project decisions, never cites an oracle, and
  says the gate pins the file. A new **Rulings** section records R1-R7 with the
  sources the user cited: check status and submission legality (R1, H36);
  activation is the count rule (R2, closing Q1); the rulebook itself (R3, H38);
  the pawn's double step along both axes for both colours (R4, Q15 in part); no
  repetition rule, a project decision, and self-play's turn cap a convention (R5,
  H39, I11); castling and en passant attack tests per-board (R6, H40); the two
  oracle defects go upstream (R7). The entries they settle say so: T10, 4.6, C3,
  C4, C6, C7, D2, S2, S7, Q1, Q10, Q15, Q21, Q23. One addition is marked
  *derived*, not ruled: a pinned attacker counts (C3, from R1's "could capture").
- `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`: CHECKPOINT 1 marked ruled; step 4 unparked; the parked list
  rewritten; the engine's parse-mode reading of the corpus classified (Q4, the
  annotation policy, notation outside the spec); register status for H31 and
  H36-H40, I11; spec issue 10 and proposed edit 10 resolved upstream.
- Spec: §11.0 items 1-5 and "Triage by cluster" (H31, H36-H40), §12.3 (I11) - in
  the documents already; no proposed edit.

### 2026-10-01 - Design documents: the CHECKPOINT 1 rulings, from upstream

- `docs/design/` replaced with the upstream revision that records the user's
  rulings on CHECKPOINT 1: register rows H36 (check status - pass on all active
  boards in the present - versus submission legality - any royal capture from any
  of the opponent's playable boards after the actual turn), H37 (a mate verdict is
  a proof: an exhaustive search that terminated; an exhausted budget is
  "unknown"), H38 (`docs/rules/README.md` is the rulebook), H39 (no repetition
  rule, a project decision), H40 (castling and en passant attack tests are
  per-board), I11 (self-play's turn cap, a convention scored as a draw); spec
  §11.0 items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 rewritten accordingly, §8.5, §8.7, §10.4.3, §12.3,
  §12.6 and §14.4 follow from H39, reversal 21 (castling's attack test) recorded,
  and the architecture document gains the append-only-state and terminal-proof
  notes. Copied in unchanged; nothing here edits them.
- Spec: the documents themselves (§8.5, §8.7, §10.4.3, §11.0, §12.3, §12.6, §14.4;
  H21, H36-H40, I11, part J reversal 21, part K).

### 2026-10-01 - Engine CI: build on g++ 13 and 14

- The engine's first Linux run failed: g++ 13 and 14 at -O2 warn, wrongly, that
  copying a disengaged `std::optional<Colour>` may read its payload
  (`-Wmaybe-uninitialized`), and warnings are errors. `engine/tests/test_zobrist.cpp`
  now assigns the optional only when it holds a value.
- `engine/build.py --keep-going` builds every target it can, so one run reports
  every compile error; the engine workflow uses it.
- Spec: no part of the spec describes the build scripts.

### 2026-10-01 - The rules engine, first stages (E1, E2): representation, turn rules, moves, parser

- `engine/` (C++20, CMake; `py engine/build.py --test`; manual `engine/README.md`),
  written from `docs/rules/README.md`, the design spec and the notation
  specification's text - never from an oracle (H24, H26, H28):
  - E1: immutable boards (A4) in a persistent multiverse; 5DFEN read and write;
    the H30 fingerprint (the notation spec's full-state hash; both published
    hashes reproduce) with an MD5 written from RFC 1321; the 5D Zobrist key (H18:
    a per-board content hash mixed with (timeline, half-turn) by multiply-rotate,
    combined by addition so duplicated boards never cancel, with the ruleset ID,
    player to move, parity, creators and board size); a C API for Python.
  - E2: the present, timeline activation and reactivation, the turn state machine
    and submission's present-shift test (T1-T13); pseudo-legal moves for every
    piece in 4D (4.1-4.13, J1-J9); move application with branching and timeline
    numbering; castling with the on-board attack test (S2), en passant within a
    board, promotion; the 5dpgn/5DFEN parser and the variants that have an
    independent source; `t5d-gate --parse-only`, the engine's gate adapter.
  - Every open question of the rules reference is a named ruleset parameter with
    the documented default. Check detection, the royal-safety test at submission
    and mate detection are hooks only: they wait on the check ruling (CHECKPOINT 1).
  - 259 tests, warning-free with -Werror, also under an undefined-behaviour
    sanitizer; the parser survived 300,000 fuzzed records. Each stage was reviewed
    adversarially (the one major finding - every move copied its timelines' whole
    history - is fixed by sharing history in chunks).
- `.github/workflows/engine.yml`: builds and tests the engine on ubuntu-24.04 with
  g++ 13 and 14, warnings as errors, without checking out any submodule.
- `CLAUDE.md` describes the engine; `PROVENANCE.md` notes that its MD5 follows RFC
  1321 and its Zobrist key generator uses published constants, with no code
  copied; `.gitignore` ignores the build tree and the project `.venv`.
- Spec: §11.0 (the rules engine's five pieces: items 2, 4 and 5 built; 1 and 3
  parked), §11.3 (the Zobrist key - proposed spec edit 2), H18, H22, H24, H28,
  H30; spec issues 11-15 and proposed spec edit 11 in `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`.

### 2026-10-01 - CHECKPOINT 1: the check disagreements, clustered and traced

- `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-1-check-clusters.md`: the 78 check disagreements
  between ftxi and Chess in 5D (all at positions where both hold the same state,
  H30) in seven clusters by the attacker's situation, four rule questions, every
  oracle's verdict at a representative position drawn board by board, and the
  traces of the two mate disagreements (a Chess in 5D mate-search defect) and of
  the 52-vs-54 count (an ftxi move-generator defect for black pawns' two-timeline
  steps, beside rules question Q15). Written by a collector, a clusterer, three
  skeptics (16 findings, all applied) and a finaliser, from fresh runs of the
  pinned oracles; nothing adjudicated, no oracle's side taken.
- `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`: the checkpoint summary, the questions put to the user, and
  everything parked until the check ruling.
- Spec: §11.0 "Triage by cluster; settle by rulebook" (H31) - the triage is done;
  the settling waits on the user's ruling and the rulebook question (proposed spec
  edit 10). No spec text changes.

### 2026-10-01 - The tiered CI is green on Linux (H35)

- Pushed to the remote for the first time. The commit tier (run 36827435595) and
  the nightly tier (run 36827459456, started by hand) both passed on ubuntu-24.04
  at their first run: the golden files recorded on Windows reproduce exactly on
  Linux (ftxi, cwmtt, Chess in 5D and the notation parser 100%). The naive
  searches reproduce less on the slower runner (ftxi:naive 95.9%, cwmtt:naive
  98.4%) and pass only by the coverage floors that H32 replaces next.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `oracles/README.md` no longer
  say the workflows have never run; they say the workflows run on Linux and are
  not yet required checks on the branch.
- Spec: §11.0 "Linux CI before engine code" and §15.1 (Phase 0 order) - H35 is
  met; register H35 is done. No spec text changes.

### 2026-10-01 - The gate matches states, not move counts (H30)

- **Every source now says what it set up, at every position.** Before the position
  event and any search, each driver prints a `state` event listing every board it
  holds (`L:T:c:placement`). The harness alone (`oracles/oracle_harness/fingerprint.py`)
  validates, canonicalises and hashes it: `fingerprint` is the notation
  specification's full-state hash (MD5 of the sorted `[placement:L:T:c]` strings,
  -0 before +0, then turn, then white before black - the notation is silent on the
  colour order), `placement` the same without unmoved markers, plus board and
  piece counts. Both published hashes of the notation spec are conformance tests.
- **Parse divergences are their own class** (`placement`, `unmoved`). A placement
  divergence ends every comparison of that pair from that position on, and a
  known-divergence entry for one must cite the notation specification; a
  marker-only run is reported per run and stops the confirmation, not the
  comparison. The engine contract now requires a `state` event at every position.
- **Drivers.** ftxi: the board walk of its own API, held to the stock `5dtools`
  (`stats` board count and size, and its `print` drawing read back into a
  placement hash). Chess in 5D: the library's own full-state export, and its own
  hash must equal the harness's at every position; custom set-ups it relabels are
  refused. cwmtt: a new Haskell state driver (`oracles/drivers/cwmtt/Driver.hs`)
  compiled against cwmtt's modules runs beside the stock CLI, which still answers
  the counts; the adapter pairs the two only where they read and replayed the
  record alike, and cwmtt now reports the side to move. New: the notation
  repository's bundled parser is a parse-only oracle, `notation` (decision H26, as
  the brief asked), run through `oracles/drivers/notation/driver.js` in every tier;
  the commit workflow now sets up Node for it.
- **Diagnostics** for the check-cluster triage, never compared or recorded:
  `harness.py observe --explain` (ftxi: the timelines it advances to phantom boards
  and the checking moves it finds) and `observe --actions K` (every source's legal
  actions at position K, canonicalised for diffing).
- **Golden files re-recorded (schema 2)**: four new columns per position, and a
  `notation.json`. No answer of ftxi, Chess in 5D or cwmtt changed. cwmtt's
  positions now carry the side to move (1,598 filled, no conflict). A run cut by
  its time budget now keeps the position it was searching, with its boards and no
  answers, so the timed-out naive runs show one more position each. One recorded
  answer was lost to time: cwmtt:naive's final verdict on `cwmtt/ctp1` (about
  257 s of a 300 s budget on this desktop) timed out under load - the
  budget-limited case H32 classifies next.
- **Result:** across the whole corpus, no two sources hold different boards at any
  shared position, so every check, count and mate disagreement in
  `oracles/DISAGREEMENTS.md` is a rules disagreement. The one parse-layer difference
  is markers-only on Very Small - Open (ftxi's built-in layout holds the kings and
  rooks as moved), which leaves that variant ungated until settled. `verify`
  clean; `gate --tier commit`: ftxi 7760/7760 and notation 2765/2765 recorded values
  reproduced; selftest 454 tests.
- Also: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` list `fingerprint.py` among
  the files whose edit stales the golden files, and the cwmtt state driver among
  those that need a rebuild.
- Spec: §11.0 "Running the gate" (H30) and its oracle table (the notation parser as
  a parse-only oracle in every tier, H26/H27) - proposed edit 3 in
  `docs/BUILD_LOG.md` (the fingerprint, its readings, marker-only runs, the oracle
  hash check); spec issue 2h (what "unmoved" means). Register H30 is built; its row
  is unchanged.

### 2026-10-01 - A cited rules reference, from public non-oracle sources

- `docs/rules/README.md`: the rules of *5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel* as
  testable statements (lattice and coordinates, turns and the present, active
  timelines, super-physical moves and branching, every piece's movement, castling,
  en passant, promotion, check, checkmate, stalemate, softmate, draws and
  repetition, variant starting positions), each with a confidence and verbatim
  citations, and 28 open questions where sources are silent or disagree. No rules
  implementation or its documentation was used, and no oracle was run or its
  output read: the reference has to be able to judge the oracles. Its official
  sources are the game's in-game Guide texts, read as text from the client
  installed on the development machine (no program logic inspected; the client is
  never an oracle, H25), and developer posts; community sources are weighted by
  author, so that implementers whose independence is unknown never carry a rule
  alone. Written by five researchers, a synthesizer, three citation skeptics (68
  problems found and fixed) and a reviser.
- Why: nothing in the repository pinned a rulebook (spec issue 1 in
  `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`); the engine's rules are written from this reference, and
  its open questions - which boards a check test passes (Q10), activation (Q1-Q3),
  repetition (Q23) - go to the user as rulings.
- Spec: §11.0 says disagreements are settled "by rulebook" and names none; the
  reference is proposed as the project's rulebook in `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`
  (proposed spec edit 10), pending the user's choice.

### 2026-10-01 - Project licence recorded (M11); the build log; spec edits proposed, not made

- `PROVENANCE.md` records the project's licence: the GPL-3.0, the `LICENSE` file
  from the repository's initial commit (register M11). Its obligations attach on
  distribution of source or binaries, not on private use or on running the engine
  as a service; the BSD-2 code adapted into the ftxi driver is compatible, with its
  notice kept; Stockfish and Lc0 code stays out to keep sole copyright (H29);
  whether the licence reaches trained weights is open, to decide before any are
  distributed. Its section on where the spec and the pinned reality differ now
  says which differences the current spec has corrected (J20, H26) and which
  remain.
- `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`: the resume document for the untrained build (spec §15) -
  the standing rules of the build, what is done, parked and next keyed by register
  ID, the spec issues found, and the spec edits proposed. `docs/MEASUREMENTS.md`:
  every measured figure with its conditions, and the §15.6 verdicts.
- The spec and the register are maintained upstream: `AGENTS.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CLAUDE.md` now say they are never edited here - an edit
  they need is proposed in the build log and applied upstream, and a measured
  figure goes into `docs/MEASUREMENTS.md` with its write-back (M4) proposed.
- Spec: M11 is recorded as the register states it; no spec text changes.
  Proposed: §11.0 "Tiered CI" should say ftxi runs through a C++ driver, not its
  Python bindings (`docs/BUILD_LOG.md`, proposed spec edit 1).

### 2026-10-01 - CI: oracle builds cached, toolchains installed only for stale builds

- `.github/workflows/oracle-nightly.yml`: the oracle builds
  (`oracles/.cache/build`) are restored and saved as separate steps - saved as
  soon as they are built, so they survive a run whose gate then fails (a single
  cache step saves only when the whole job succeeds). After a driver or recipe
  change the newest older cache is restored, and the harness rebuilds only the
  builds whose own keys moved. GHC 9.10.3 is installed only when a stale build
  needs it - only cwmtt's does - so a nightly run with a current cwmtt build
  skips the heaviest toolchain entirely.
- `oracles/.cache/build/ftxi` in `oracle-commit.yml` is restored and saved the
  same way. That workflow can now also be started by hand.
- New: `python oracles/harness.py build --plan` builds nothing and prints, as one
  line `tools=<names>`, the build tools the oracles without an up-to-date build
  still need (`build.tools_needed()`, tested in `oracles/tests/test_build.py`).
  The workflow asks the harness instead of naming an oracle: CI configuration may
  not name an oracle's package, and cwmtt's repository name is its Haskell
  package name, which the boundary check refuses there.
- Why: H35 asks for the tiered CI green on Linux, and the nightly tier has to stay
  cheap enough to run every night.
- Spec: §11.0 ("Tiered CI") describes the tiers, not how CI caches; not changed.

### 2026-10-01 - Agent permissions: push allowed, force-push and GitHub file writes denied

- `.claude/settings.json`: `git push` is allowed without a prompt, from both the
  Bash and the PowerShell tool. Force pushes are denied, and deny rules beat
  allow rules: `--force` and `--force-with-lease` anywhere in the command, `-f`
  as its own argument, and a `+refspec`. The GitHub MCP server's three
  file-writing tools (`create_or_update_file`, `push_files`, `delete_file`) are
  denied, so an agent cannot commit to the remote except through a local commit
  and a push.
- The rules match the command's text, so they are a guard, not a boundary. They
  do not catch `git -C <dir> push -f`, a combined short flag such as `-uf`, a git
  alias, or a push run from a script. Checked by running each force form
  against a remote that does not exist, with `--dry-run`: every one was denied
  in both tools, and a plain push was not.
- Spec: no section describes the developer tooling; not changed.

### 2026-10-01 - The design documents, under docs/design/

- Added the design spec (`docs/design/5d-chess-transformer-design.md`), the
  decision register (`docs/design/5d-chess-decisions.md`) and the general
  architecture the design instantiates
  (`docs/design/scalable-transformers-architecture.md`), as supplied: the current
  copies, carrying register row M11 and spec §15.6. They were kept untracked in a
  folder named `Specification documents/`; every reference to that path
  (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the boundary's documentation list
  in `oracles/gate.toml`, and a harness test that classifies this repository's own
  files) now names `docs/design/`. Their text is unchanged: they are maintained
  upstream.
- These copies already carry the corrections the oracle work below found owing:
  register J20 removes the claims that cwmtt's checkmate tool uses z3 and that
  ftxi packs a coordinate into 8 bits, and H26 names the notation specification as
  the fourth submodule.
- Spec: these are the spec and the register; not otherwise changed.

### 2026-10-01 - GitHub remote; the graft shims carry no local path

- Added the GitHub repository as `origin`
  (https://github.com/Silicon-Spider/Temporal-5D). GitHub created it with a
  commit of its own - `LICENSE` (the GPL-3.0 text) and a two-line `README.md` -
  so the graft commit, never pushed, was rebased onto it: e1b6980 is now
  a56beb4. Nothing has been pushed yet. The project's licence is still being
  decided, and whether that `LICENSE` file stays is part of the decision. The
  oracle work stays uncommitted, as before. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `oracles/README.md` no longer say the repository has no
  remote: they say nothing has been pushed to it.
- `.claude/helpers/graft-hooks.cjs` and `.claude/helpers/graft-statusline.cjs`:
  the first place the shims look for graft (`BAKED`), which `graft init` writes
  as an absolute path into the installing user's profile, is now the same
  directory found from node's own install directory (npm's global root on
  Windows), so the commit carries no local path. Re-running `graft init` writes
  the absolute path again. `PROVENANCE.md` records the change.
- Spec: no section describes the developer tooling, the remote, or the
  project's own licence; not changed.

### 2026-10-01 - Every change goes in the changelog and the spec

- Added this file, and a rule - stated in full in `AGENTS.md` (for coding agents,
  and imported by `CLAUDE.md`) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (for people), and pointed to
  from `CLAUDE.md` - that a change is finished only when it is recorded here and
  the design spec and the decision register say what is now true, in the same
  edit. The pin procedure in `CONTRIBUTING.md` gains the step that does this for
  a pin bump.
- Why: the register already requires a decision to change in the spec and the
  register together; this carries the same discipline to every change, and gives
  one place to see what changed.
- Spec: no section describes how changes are recorded; not changed. The entry
  below still owes its spec updates.

### 2026-09-30 to 2026-10-01 - The oracle side of the rules-engine gate (H27)

- Added `oracles/`, a separate, standard-library-only Python project: the
  differential-testing harness of spec §11.0 (decisions H23-H29). Commands:
  `sync`, `doctor`, `build`, `verify`, `selftest`, `gate`, `golden`, `observe`,
  `corpus`, `boundary`, `provenance`. Its manual is `oracles/README.md`.
- Pinned as git submodules under `oracles/third_party/`: ftxi/5dchess_engine
  (v0.4.10), penteract/cwmtt, 5d-chess-js (the rules library of Chess in 5D), and
  adri326/5dchess-notation as a source of game records. Commits, licences and
  toolchains are in `oracles/oracles.lock.toml`.
- Drivers of our own for ftxi (C++; part of it adapted from ftxi's tools, under
  its BSD-2-Clause notice) and 5d-chess-js (Node). cwmtt runs through its stock
  command-line program.
- A pinned corpus of 41 game records (37 read in place from the submodules, 4
  written here); each oracle's recorded answers (`oracles/golden/`); the generated
  `oracles/DISAGREEMENTS.md`; an empty `oracles/known-divergences.toml`.
- The boundary check that keeps the engine from using the harness or an oracle; a
  gate in three tiers (commit, nightly, release); two GitHub Actions workflows,
  which have never run (the repository has no remote).
- `PROVENANCE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitattributes`,
  and `.gitignore` entries for the harness cache and Python byte-code.
- Why: H27 - the oracles and the gate exist before the rules engine, so that the
  gate cannot be skipped or bent to fit it.
- Spec: not yet brought in line. Pinning found statements in §11.0 and the register
  that are no longer true, listed in `PROVENANCE.md` under "Where the design spec
  and the pinned reality differ": cwmtt no longer uses z3; ftxi packs a coordinate
  into 32 bits, not 8 (one of H24's stated reasons); ftxi runs through a C++ driver
  and its stock CLI, not its Python bindings; a fourth repository, the notation
  specification, is pinned; and no oracle answers every question the gate asks.

### 2026-09-30 - graft wiring (commit e1b6980, rebased as a56beb4)

- Added the wiring of graft, a code-navigation tool for coding agents:
  `.claude/helpers/`, `.claude/skills/graft/`, and entries in
  `.claude/settings.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.ignore` and `.gitignore`. Developer
  tooling: nothing in the engine or the harness depends on it.
- Spec: not affected.
